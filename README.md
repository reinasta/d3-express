A starter project that calls D3.js from a full stack Express.js app.

I'm using NodeJs v.14 with ES modules, plus Sass (as CSS extension), and Handlebars as view engine. Styles from the water.css collection.

# Getting started

Clone this project

```
git clone https://github.com/reinasta/d3-express.git my-project
```

Navigate to the newly created directory:

```
cd my-project
```

Install the dependencies 

```
npm install
```

Start the project

```
npm start
```

And view it at http://localhost:3000/
